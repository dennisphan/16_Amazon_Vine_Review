# 16_Amazon_Vine_Review
 
## Overview
The purpose of this projec is to verify any bias reviews the vine program has in comparison with non-vine reviews. To do so, all vine and non-vine reviews will be assessed to see if there is an significant difference between the two types. 

## Results
 - In the provided dataset, there are 403807 valid unpaid review but only 2 valid vine reviews. 
 - Among two vine reviews, only 1 five star review which lead to a percentage of 50%. 
 - Among 403807 non-Vine review, there are 242889 five star reviews, equivalent to 60.15%. 

## Summary
 - While there are only 2 vine reviews, it is not enough to make a conclusion about the vine program.
 - Assume that the 50% five star vine review is valid, this percentage is far less than 60.15% of five star non-vine reviews. Therefore, it is not sufficient to conclude that there is a bias in leaving reviews when customers get paid to do so under the vine program. 
 - To have a better analysis in the future, more vine reviews should be collected. There should be at least 30 vine reviews so that any conclusion can be made.
